#Text editor on Java (Swing)

This is a pretty simple desktop application to work with text files.

The application reflects some graphics capabilities of Swing library.
Due to it's a training project, I found it unnecessary to implement all the functionalities.

What application features are available:
- opening text files and editing ones
- save, overwrite files
- working with files in several tabs at the same time
- opening internet resources (browser functionality)
- changing the background color of the editor

When the program starts, a simple authorization checking for the password is implemented.
Also, a code base has been prepared for saving and restoring program settings, but hasn't been implemented yet.
